# Lyft Data Analysis
[Link to the webpage](https://kennywf.github.io/lyft_data_analysis/)

Our mission was to analyze publicly available rideshare data from 2014. The LYFT data sourced contained pick-ups across all of NYC, including the time and location (latitude & longitude) of the pickup. 

Prior to analyzing the data, a hypothesis was created based on the fields provided. The data was transformed using excel and a RESTful API was created using Flask. A combination of HTML, JavaScript, Plotly and D3 was used to create a heatmap, cluster, marker and graphs to help visually analyze the data.
